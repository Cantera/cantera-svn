This example program solves the Blasius boundary value problem for the
velocity profile of a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. It
uses class BoundaryValueProblem, which provides a simplified interface
to the boundary value problem capabilities of Cantera.

To build this example, type "ctnew" to generate a demo c++ program and
a makefile (demo.mak) that is correctly configured for your Cantera
installation. It it is not on your path, you can find the ctnew script
in the "bin" directory of your Cantera installation directory. 

First make sure the Cantera demo works by typing "make -f demo.mak",
then "./demo". Assuming this works, now edit demo.mak and change the
line "OBJS = demo.o" to "OBJS = blasius.o". You can optionally change
the program name too. Now when you rebuild the executable and run it,
it will solve the blasius boundary layer problem.
