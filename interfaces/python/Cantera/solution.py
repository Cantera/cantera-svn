class Solution(ThermoPhase, Kinetics, Transport):
    """
    A class for chemically-reacting solutions.

    Instances can be created to represent any type of solution -- a
    mixture of gases, a liquid solution, or a solid solution, for
    example.

    Class Solution derives from classes ThermoPhase, Kinetics, and
    Transport.  It defines very few methods of its own, and is
    provided largely for convenience, so that a single object can be
    used to compute thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport properties
    of a solution. Functions like IdealGasMix and others defined in
    module gases return objects of class Solution.
