    One-dimensional edge between two surfaces.

    Instances of class Edge represent reacting 1D edges between
    between 2D surfaces. Class Edge defines no methods of its
    own. All of its methods derive from either EdgePhase or Kinetics.

    Function importInterface should usually be used to build an
    Edge object from a CTI file definition, rather than calling
    the Interface constructor directly.
