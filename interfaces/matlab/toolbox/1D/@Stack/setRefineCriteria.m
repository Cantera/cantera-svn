% SETREFINECRITERIA - Set the criteria used to refine the grid.
%
%     n  --  domain number beginning with domain 1 at the left
%     ratio  --   maximum size ratio between adjacent cells
%     slope  --   maximum relative difference in value between
%                 adjacent points
%     curve  --   maximum relative difference in slope between
%                 adjacent cells
%     prune  --   minimum value for slope or curve for which points
%                 will be retained in the grid. If the computed
%                 slope or curve value is below prune for all
%                 components, it will be deleted, unless either
%                 neighboring point is already marked for deletion.
