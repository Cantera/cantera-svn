function v = maxTemp(p)
% MAXTEMP - Maximum temperature.
% 
%   The parameterizations used to represent the temperature-dependent
%   species thermodynamic properties are generally only valid in some
%   finite temperature range, which may be different for each species
%   in the phase. This method returns the highest temperature at which
%   the parameterizations are valid for all species in the phase.
