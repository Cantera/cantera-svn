/**

\page cxx-exceptions Exception Handling

%Cantera throws exceptions of type CanteraError when an error is encountered. Your program should always catch these. You can throw CanteraError exceptions too, if you like, or you can use your own application-specific exception classes. 

\include except.cpp

The function \c showErrors is a convenient way to display the error
message in the \c catch block. The \c error function prints an error
and terminates execution. Note that both of these functions are
environment-specific; i.e. they behave differently if you are running
your Cantera code embedded in a MATLAB application than if you run it
as a stand-alone C++ application. \see textlogs

The output generated when this program is run is shown below.
\verbatim
************************************************
                   Cantera Error!                  
************************************************


Procedure: mycode
Error:     test of exception throwing and catching
