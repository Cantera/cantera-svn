\page installnumarray  Installing numarray

If you plan to use %Cantera from Python, or want to run any of the Python demo scripts, or use the graphical MixMaster application, then you need to install the 'numarray' package.

Numarray provides capabilities for Python to work efficiently work large matrices, and is
used by the %Cantera Python package.

\section numWin Installing numarray on Windows

If you are using a PC running Windows, go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy and download the Windows binary installer for numarray. All you need to do is to execute this installer to install numarray.

\section numUnix Building and Installing numarray on a unix-like platform

On a unix-like (linux, Mac OS X) platform, you need to build numarray from source code. The procedure to do this is largely automated, and takes only a few minutes. Here's what you do:

    - Get the source code from http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy. This file should have a 
      name like numarray-1.x.x.tar.gz.
    - Unpack the compresssed tar archive:
      \verbatim 
      gunzip numarray-1.x.x.tar.gz
      tar xvf numarray-1.x.x.tar \endverbatim
    - Go into the directory created by unpacking the archive, and type at a shell prompt
      \verbatim 
      python setup.py build \endverbatim
      This compiles everything, and puts the files in a temporary directory, ready to be 
      installed wherever you specify in the next step.
    .

\section numAll Installing numarray for all users

If your are the system administrator and want to install numaray so that every user can access it, then simply type

\verbatim
python setup.py install
\endverbatim

You will probably have to run this command as super-user. Doing the install step this way will put 
the numarray module in the 'site-packages' subdirectory within the python 'lib' directory. This 
has the advantage that Python always looks in this directory for modules -- there is no need to 
set PYTHONPATH for the interpreter to find numarray. But it does require write access to the 
Python 'lib' directory, which typically only the system administrator has.

\section numLocal Installing a local version of numarray

If you are not the system administrator, then you can install a local version of numarray in your 
home directory by adding the --home option to the 'install' step. For example, if you want to 
install all numarray files within a directory named 'python_modules' in your home directory, then do this:

\verbatim
python setup.py build
python setup.py install --home=$HOME/python_modules
\endverbatim

Note that if you use the --home option, you will need to configure %Cantera so that it knows where to 
find numarray. To do this, you can either set environment variable NUMARRAY_HOME to the directory 
you specified with the --home option (e.g. $HOME/python_modules), or edit the 
cantera 'preconfig' script to set this variable there.
