# This Makefile builds a Fortran 77 application that uses Cantera.  By
# default, the main program file is 'demo.f,' which prints out some
# properties of a reacting gas mixture. It uses the library
# 'demo_ftnlib.cpp,' which contains Fortran-callable functions that
# are implemented with C++ calls to Cantera.

# To build program 'demo', simply type 'make', or 'make -f <this
# file>' if this file is named something other than 'Makefile.'  

# Once you have verified that the demo runs, edit this file to replace
# object file 'demo.o' with your own object file or files. You may
# continue to use 'demo_ftnlib' if it serves your needs, or else
# replace it with a different interface library.
