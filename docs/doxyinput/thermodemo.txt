/**
\page cxx-thermodemo A C++ Thermodynamics Properties Program

In the program below, a gas mixture object is created, and a few thermodynamic properties are computed and printed out. 

\include thermodemo.cpp

Note that the methods that compute the properties take no input
parameters. The properties are computed for the state that has been
previously set and stored internally within the object.
 
\section cxx-thermonaming Naming Conventions
- methods that return molar properties have names that end in \c "_mole". 
- methods that return properties per unit mass have names that end in
  \c "_mass".
- methods that write an array of values into a supplied output array
have names that begin with "get". For example, method \c
getChemPotentials(double* mu) writes the species chemical potentials
into the output array \a mu.

The thermodynamic property methods are declared in class ThermoPhase,
which is the base class from which all classes that represent any
type of phase of matter derive.
