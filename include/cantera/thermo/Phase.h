//! Base class for phases of matter
/*!
 * Base class for phases of matter. Class Phase derives from both
 * Constituents and State. In addition to the methods of those two
 * classes, it implements methods that allow referencing a species
 * by name.
 *
 * Manages the independent variables of temperature, mass density,
 * and species mass/mole fraction that define the thermodynamic
 * state.
 * Class State stores just enough information about a
 * multicomponent solution to specify its intensive thermodynamic
 * state.  It stores values for the temperature, mass density, and
 * an array of species mass fractions. It also stores an array of
 * species molecular weights, which are used to convert between
 * mole and mass representations of the composition. These are the
 * \e only properties of the species that class State knows about.
 * For efficiency in mass/mole conversion, the vector of mass
 * fractions divided by molecular weight \f$ Y_k/M_k \f$ is also
 * stored.
 *
 * Class State is not usually used directly in application
 * programs. Its primary use is as a base class for class
 * Phase. Class State has no virtual methods, and none of its
 * methods are meant to be overloaded. However, this is one exception.
 *  If the phase is incompressible, then the density must be replaced
 *  by the pressure as the independent variable. In this case, functions
 *  such as setMassFraction within the class %State must actually now
 *  calculate the density (at constant T and P) instead of leaving
 *  it alone as befits an independent variable. Threfore, these type
 *  of functions are virtual functions and need to be overloaded
 *  for incompressible phases. Note, for almost incompressible phases
 *  (or phases which utilize standard states based on a T and P) this
 *  may be advantageous as well, and they need to overload these functions
 *  too.
 *
 * Class %Constituents is designed to provide information
 * about the elements and species in a phase - names, index
 * numbers (location in arrays), atomic or molecular weights,
 * etc. No computations are performed by the methods of this
 * class. The set of elements must include all those that compose
 * the species, but may include additional elements. The species
 * all must belong to the same phase.
 *
 * @ingroup phases
 *
 *  Class Phase derives from both classes
 *  Constituents and State. In addition to the methods of those two
 *  classes, it implements methods that allow referencing a species
 *  by name. And, it contains a lot of utility functions that will
 *  set the %State of the phase in its entirety, by first setting
 *  the composition, then the temperature and then the density.
 *  An example of this is the function,
 *    Phase::setState_TRY(doublereal t, doublereal dens, const doublereal* y).
 *
 *  Class Phase contains method for saving and restoring the
 *  full internal states of each phase. These are called Phase::saveState()
 *  and Phase::restoreState(). These functions operate on a state
 *  vector, which is in general of length (2 + nSpecies()). The first
 *  two entries of the state vector is temperature and density.
 *
 *  The class Phase contains two strings that identify a phase.
 *  The string id() is the value of the ID attribute of the XML phase node
 *  that is used to initialize a phase when it is read it.
 *  The id() field will stay that way even if the name is changed.
 *  The name field is also set to the value of the ID attribute of
 *  the XML phase node.
 *
 *  However, the name field  may be changed to another value during the course of a calculation.
 *  For example, if a phase is located in two places, but has the same
 *  constitutive input, the id's of the two phases will be the same,
 *  but the names of the two phases may be different.
 *
 *  The name of a phase can be the same as the id of that same phase.
 *  Actually, this is the default and normal condition to have the name and
 *  the id for each phase to be the same. However, it is expected that
 *  it's an error to have two phases in a single problem with the same name.
 *  or the same id (or the name from one phase being the same as the id
 *  of another phase).
 *  Thus, it is expected that there is a 1-1 correspondence between
 *  names and unique phases within a Cantera problem.
 *
 *  A species name may be referred to via three methods:
 *
 *    -   "speciesName"
 *    -   "PhaseId:speciesName"
 *    -   "phaseName:speciesName"
 *    .
 *
 *  The first two methods of naming may not yield a unique species within
 *  complicated assemblies of Cantera Phases.
 *
 *
 *  @todo
 *   Make the concept of saving state vectors more general, so that
 *   it can handle other cases where there are additional internal state
 *   variables, such as the voltage, a potential energy, or a strain field.
