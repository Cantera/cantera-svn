 *    The model is based on that described by Kee, Coltrin, and Glarborg, "Theoretical and
 *    Practical Aspects of Chemically Reacting Flow Modeling."
 *
 *
 * The viscosity is computed using the Wilke mixture rule (kg /m /s)
 *
 *    \f[
 *        \mu = \sum_k \frac{\mu_k X_k}{\sum_j \Phi_{k,j} X_j}.
 *    \f]
 *
 *     Here \f$ \mu_k \f$ is the viscosity of pure species \e k, and
 *
 *    \f[
 *        \Phi_{k,j} = \frac{\left[1
 *                     + \sqrt{\left(\frac{\mu_k}{\mu_j}\sqrt{\frac{M_j}{M_k}}\right)}\right]^2}
 *                     {\sqrt{8}\sqrt{1 + M_k/M_j}}
 *    \f]
 *
 *
 * The thermal conductivity is computed from the following mixture rule:
 *   \f[
 *          \lambda = 0.5 \left( \sum_k X_k \lambda_k  + \frac{1}{\sum_k X_k/\lambda_k} \right)
 *   \f]
 *
 *  It's used to compute the flux of energy due to a thermal gradient
 *
 *   \f[
 *          j_T =  - \lambda  \nabla T
 *   \f]
 *
 *  The flux of energy has units of energy (kg m2 /s2) per second per area.
 *
 *  The units of lambda are W / m K which is equivalent to kg m / s^3 K.
