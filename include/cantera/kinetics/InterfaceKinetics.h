/*!
 *
 *    There are some important additions to the behavior of the kinetics class due to the
 *    presence of multiple phases and a heterogeneous interface.  If a reactant phase
 *    doesn't exists, i.e., has a mole number of zero, a heterogeneous reaction can not
 *    proceed from reactants to products. Note it could perhaps proceed from products to
 *    reactants if all of the product phases exist.
 *
 *    In order to make the determination of whether a phase exists or not actually involves
 *    the specification of additional information to the kinetics object., which heretofore
 *    has only had access to intrinsic field information about the phases (i.e., temperature
 *    pressure, and mole fraction).
 *
 *    The extrinsic specification of whether a phase exists or not  must be specified on top of the
 *    intrinsic calculation of the reaction rate.  This routine carries a set of
 *    booleans indicating whether a phase in the heterogeneous mechanism exists or not.
 *
 *    Additionally, the routine carries a set of booleans around indicating whether a product
 *    phase is stable or not. If a phase is not thermodynamically stable, it may be the case that
 *    a particular reaction in a heterogeneous mechanism will create a product species in the
 *    unstable phase. However, other reactions in the mechanism will destruct that species.
 *    This may cause oscillations in the formation of the unstable phase from time step to time
 *    step within a ODE solver, in practice. In order to avoid this situation, a set of
 *    booleans is tracked which sets the stability of a phase. If a phase is deemed to be unstable,
 *    then species in that phase will not be allowed to be birthed by the kinetics operator.
 *    Nonexistent phases are deemed to be unstable by default, but this can be changed.
