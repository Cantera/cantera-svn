 * @defgroup inputfiles Input File Handling
 *
 * The properties of phases and interfaces are specified in
 * text files. These procedures handle various aspects of reading
 * these files.
 *
 * For input files not specified by an absolute pathname,
 * %Cantera searches
 * for input files along a path that includes platform-specific
 * default locations, and possibly user-specified locations.
 *
 * The current directory (".") is always searched first. Then, on
 * Windows platforms, if environment variable COMMONPROGRAMFILES
 * is set (which it should be on Win XP or Win 2000), then
 * directories under this one will be added to the search
 * path. The %Cantera Windows installer installs data files to this
 * location.
 *
 * On the Mac, directory '/Applications/Cantera/data' is added to the
 * search path.
 *
 * On any platform, if environment variable CANTERA_DATA is set to a
 * directory name, then this directory is added to the search path.
 *
 * Finally, the location where the data files were installed when
 * %Cantera was built is added to the search path.
 *
 * Additional directories may be added by calling function addDirectory.
 *
 * There are two different types of input files within %Cantera:
 *    ctml: This is an xml file laid out in such a way that %Cantera can
 *          interpret the contents.
 *    cti:  A human-readable ascii format for information that %Cantera
 *          will read.
 *
 *   %Cantera can take its input from both types of files. However, given
 *   a file in cti format, the initial operation that %Cantera will perform
 *   is to translate the cti file into a ctml file.
 *   The translation is carried out via a system call to a python interpreter
 *   program that actually carries out the translation. In general, a new
 *   ctml file is created by the translation that is written to the current
 *   local directory.
 *   The ctml file is then read back into %Cantera as the input.
 *
 * Other input routines in other modules:
 *   @see importKinetics()
 *

//! Find an input file.

 *    will be searched if a '/' or an '\\' is found in the
 *    name. If either is found then a relative path name is
 *    presumed, and the default directories are not searched.
 *
 *    The presence of the file is determined by whether the file
 *    can be opened for reading by the current user.
 *
 *  @param name Name of the input file to be searched for

 * @defgroup HTML_logs Writing HTML Logfiles
 * @ingroup logs
 *
 *  These functions are designed to allow writing HTML diagnostic
 *  messages in a manner that allows users to control how much

 *  have function A that invokes function B that invokes function
 *  C. You want to be able to print diagnostic messages just from
 *  function A, or from A and B, or from A, B, and C, or to turn
 *  off printing diagnostic messages altogether. All you need to
 *  do is call 'beginLogGroup' within function A, and specify a
 *  loglevel value. Then in B, call beginLogGroup again, but
 *  without an explicit value for loglevel. By default, the
 *  current level is decremented by one in beginLogGroup. If it
 *  is <= 0, no log messages are written. Thus, if each function
 *  begins with beginLogGroup and calls endLogGroup before
 *  returning, then setting loglevel = 3 will cause messages from
 *  A, B, and C to be written (in nested HTML lists), loglevel =
 *  2 results in messages only being written from A and B, etc.
