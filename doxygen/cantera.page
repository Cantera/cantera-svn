\section overview Overview

Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes.

With Cantera's object technology, you assemble your architectural masterpiece (i.e application program) from a set of very special bricks you pick up at the Cantera quarry! Each "brick" (or object) represents some well-defined small component of the global structure.

Cantera 2.0 is now in beta. It includes a new build system based on scons, a python build environment, with an alternative autotool system. Cantera includes several new thermodynamics and transport classes, including a large database of aqueous thermodynamics. It may be downloaded as the trunk version of cantera. Documentation for Cantera 2.0 is available at the following link.
