/**
\page cxx-headers  C++ Header Files

Cantera provides some header files designed for
use in C++ application programs. These are designed to include those
portions of the Cantera kernel needed for particular types of
calculations. For example, the header file equilibrium.h includes
header files from the kernel needed to do equilibrium calculations
(specifically, files ChemEquil.h and MultiPhaseEquil.h).

These headers are designed for use in C++ application programs, and
are not included by the Cantera kernel. The headers and their functions are:

These are:
- equilibrium.h
  - Chemical equilibrium.
- GRI30.h
  - Provides class GRI30.
- IdealGasMix.h
  - Provides class IdealGasMix.
- Interface.h
  - Provides class Interface.
- integrators.h
  - ODE Integrators.
- kinetics.h
  - Chemical kinetics.
- numerics.h
  - Classes for matrices.
- onedim.h
  - One-dimensional reacting flows.
- reactionpaths.h
  - Reaction path diagrams.
- transport.h
  - Transport properties.
- zerodim.h
  - Zero-dimensional reactor networks.
