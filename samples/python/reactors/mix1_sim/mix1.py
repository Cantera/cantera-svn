# Mixing two streams.

# Since reactors can have multiple inlets and outlets, they can be
# used to implement mixers, splitters, etc. In this example, air and
# methane are mixed in stoichiometric proportions. Due to the low
# temperature, no reactions occur. Note that the air stream and the
# methane stream use *different* reaction mechanisms, with different
# numbers of species and reactions. When gas flows from one reactor or
# reservoir to another one with a different reaction mechanism,
# species are matched by name. If the upstream reactor contains a
# species that is not present in the downstream reaction mechanism, it
# will be ignored. In general, reaction mechanisms for downstream
# reactors should contain all species that might be present in any
# upstream reactor.
