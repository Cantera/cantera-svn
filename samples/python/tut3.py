  Tutorial 3: Getting Help

"""
######################################################

# Suppose you have created a Cantera object and want to know what
# methods are available for it, and get help on using the methods. 
from Cantera import *
g = GRI30()

# The first thing you need to know is the Python class that object g
# belongs to. In Python, the class an object belongs to is stored in
# data member __class__:

print g.__class__

# To get help on this class, type
help(g.__class__)


# You can also use the Python module browser to view this same
# information in a web browser.  Under Windows, on the Start menu
# select
#   Start
#       |---Programs
#                  |---Python2.x
#                              |---Module Docs
#
# On unix, linux, or Mac OSX, at a shell prompt type
#
#   pydoc -g
#
# A small pop-up window will appear. Enter 'Cantera' in the search
# box, or else simply click on 'open browser', then navigate to the
# Cantera module, and then select what you want documentation about.


# Note: if you run into problems running the module browser this way,
# do this instead: Run 'pythonw' interactively (not 'python'), import
# module 'pydoc', and call function 'gui':
#
#  pythonw     
# >>> import pydoc
# >>> pydoc.gui()
#
