   * @defgroup thermoprops Thermodynamic Properties
   *
   *
   * These classes are used to compute the thermodynamic properties of
   * phases of matter. The main base class for describing thermodynamic 
   * properties of phases within %Cantera is called ThermoPhase. %ThermoPhase
   * is a large class that describes the interface within %Cantera to Thermodynamic
   * functions for a phase. 
   *
   * The calculation of thermodynamic functions within %ThermoPhase is 
   * broken down roughly into two or more steps. First, the standard state 
   * properties
   * of all of the species are calculated at the current temperature and at
   * either
   * the current pressure or at a reference pressure. If the calculation is
   * carried out at a reference pressure instead of at the current pressure
   * the calculation is called a "reference state properties" calculation,
   * just to make the distinction (even though it may be considered to be
   * a fixed-pressure standard-state calculation). The next step is to 
   * adjust the reference state calculation to the current pressure. The 
   * thermodynamic
   * functions then are considered to be at the standard state of each species.
   * Lastly the mixing contributions are added to arrive at the thermodynamic
   * functions for the solution.
   *
   * The %ThermoPhase class provides interfaces to thermodynamic properties 
   * calculated for 
   * the reference state of each species, the standard state values for 
   * each species, the thermodynamic functions for solution values, both
   * on a per mole of solution basis (i.e., enthalpy_mole()), on a per kg of
   * solution basis,  and on a
   * partial molar basis for each species (i.e.,  
   * getPartialMolarEnthalpies(double *hbar)).
   * At each level, functions for the enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy,
   * internal energy, and volume are provided. So, 5 levels (reference state,
   * standard state, partial molar, per mole of solution, and per mass of 
   * solution) 
   * and 5 functions multiplied together makes 25 possible functions. That's 
   * why %ThermoPhase is such a large class.
   *
   *   <H3>
   *      Categorizing the Different %ThermoPhase Objects
   *   </H3>
   *
   *   ThermoPhase objects may be catelogged into four general bins.
   *
   *   The first type are those whose underlying species have a reference state associated
   *   with them. The reference state describes the thermodynamic functions for a
   *   species at a single reference pressure, \f$p_0\f$. The thermodynamic functions
   *   are specified via derived objects of the SpeciesThermoInterpType object class, and usually
   *   consist of polynomials in temperature such as the NASA polynomial or the SHOMATE
   *   polynomial.  Calculators for these
   *   reference states, which manage the calculation for all of the species
   *   in a phase, are all derived from the virtual base class SimpleThermo. Calculators
   *   are needed because the actual calculation of the reference state thermodynamics
   *   has been shown to be relatively expensive. A great deal of work has gone
   *   into devising efficient schemes for calculating the thermodynamic polynomials
   *   of a set of species in a phase, in particular gas species in ideal gas phases
   *   whose reference state thermodynamics is specified by NASA polynomials.
   * 
   *   The reference state thermodynamics combined with the mixing rules and
   *   an assumption about the pressure dependence yields the thermodynamic functions for
   *   the phase. 
   *   Expressions involving the specification of the fugacities of species would fall into 
   *   this category of %ThermoPhase objects. Note, however, that at this time, we do not
   *   have any nontrivial examples of these types of phases.
   *   In general, the independent variables that completely describe the state of the
   *   system  for this class are temperature, the
   *   phase density, and \f$ N - 1 \f$ species mole or mass fractions. 
   *   Additionally, if the
   *   phase involves charged species, the phase electric potential is an added independent variable.
   *   Examples of the first class of %ThermoPhase functions, which includes the
   *   IdealGasPhase object, the most commonly used object with %Cantera, are given below.
   *
   *    - IdealGasPhase       in IdealGasPhase.h
   *    - StoichSubstance     in StoichSubstance.h
   *    - SurfPhase           in SurfPhase.h
   *    - EdgePhase           in EdgePhase.h
   *    - LatticePhase        in LatticePhase.h
   *    - LatticeSolidPhase   in LatticeSolidPhase.h
   *    - ConstDensityThermo  in ConstDensityThermo.h
   *    - PureFluidPhase      in PureFluidPhase.h
   *    - IdealSolidSolnPhase in IdealSolidSolnPhase.h
   *    - VPStandardStateTP   in VPStandardStateTP.h
   *
   *   The second class of objects are actually all derivatives of the VPStandardState
   *   class listed above. These classes assume that there exists a standard state
   *   for each species in the phase, where the Thermodynamic functions are specified
   *   as a function of temperature and pressure.  Standard state objects for each
   *   species are all derived from the PDSS virtual base class. Calculators for these
   *   standard state, which coordinate the calculation for all of the species
   *   in a phase, are all derived from the virtual base class VPSSMgr.
   *   In turn, these standard states may employ reference state calculation to
   *   aid in their calculations. And the VPSSMgr calculators may also employ
   *   SimpleThermo calculators to help in calculating the properties for all of the
   *   species in a phase. However, there are some PDSS objects which do not employ
   *   reference state calculations. An example of this is real equation of state for
   *   liquid water used within the calculation of brine thermodynamcis. 
   *   In general, the independent variables that completely describe the state of the
   *   system  for this class are temperature, the
   *   phase pressure, and N - 1 species mole or mass fractions or molalities. 
   *    The standard state thermodynamics combined with the mixing rules yields
   *   the thermodynamic functions for the phase. Mixing rules are given in terms
   *   of specifying the molar-base activity coefficients or activities.
   *   Lists of phases which belong to this group are given below
   *
   *    - IdealSolnGasVPSS  in IdealSolnGasVPSS.h 
   *    - MolalityVPSSTP    in MolalityVPSSTP.h 
   *
   *   Note, the ideal gas and ideal solution approximations are lumped together
   *   in the class IdealSolnGasVPSS, because at this level they look alike having
   *   the same mixing rules with respect to the specification of the excess 
   *   thermodynamic properties.
   *
   *   The third class of objects are actually all derivatives of the MolalityVPSSTP
   *   object. They assume that the standard states are temperature and 
   *   pressure dependent. But, they also assume that the standard states are 
   *   molality-based. In other words they assume that the standard state of the solute
   *   species are in a pseudo state of 1 molality but at infinite dilution.
   *   A solvent must be specified in these calculations. The solvent is assumed
   *   to be species zero, and its standard state is the pure solvent state.
   *   Lists of phases which belong to this group are:
   *
   *   - DebyeHuckel     in DebyeHuckel.h
   *   - IdealMolalSoln  in IdealMolalSoln.h  
   *   - HMWSoln         in HMWSoln.h
   *  
   *   The fourth class of %ThermoPhase objects are stoichiometric phases.
   *   Stoichiometric phases are phases which consist of one and only one
   *   species. The class  SingleSpeciesTP is the base class for these
   *   substances. Within the class, the general %ThermoPhase interface is
   *   dumbed down so that phases consisting of one species may be
   *   succinctly described.
   *   These phases may have PDSS classes or SimpleThermo calculators associated
   *   with them.
   *   In general, the independent variables that completely describe the state of the
   *   system  for this class are temperature and either the
   *   phase density or the phase pressure.
   *   Lists of classes in this group are given below.
   *
   *   - StoichSubstanceSSTP  in StoichSubstanceSSTP.h
   *   - WaterSSTP            in WaterSSTP.h
   *
   *   The reader may note that there are duplications in functionality in the
   *   above lists. This is true. And, it's used for the internal verification of
   *   capabilities within %Cantera's unit tests.
   *
   *
   * <H3>
   * Setting the %State of the phase
   * </H3>
   *
   *   Typically, the way the ThermoPhase object works is that there are a set 
   *   of functions that set the state of the phase via setting the internal 
   *   independent variables. Then, there are another set of functions that
   *   query the thermodynamic functions evalulated at the current %State of the
   *   phase. Internally, most of the intermediate work generally occurs at the
   *   point where the internal state of the system is set and not at the time
   *   when individual thermodynamic functions are queried (though the actual
   *   breakdown in work is dependent on the individual derived ThermoPhase object).
   *   Therefore, for efficiency, the user should lump together queries of thermodynamic functions
   *   after setting the state. Moreover, in setting the state, if the
   *   density is the independent variable, the following order should be
   *   used:
   *
   *      - Set the temperature
   *      - Set the mole or mass fractions or set the molalities
   *      - set the pressure. 
   *
   *   For classes which inherit from VPStandardStateTP, the above order may
   *   be used, or the following order may be used. It's not important.
   *
   *      - Set the temperature
   *      - Set the pressure
   *      - Set the mole or mass fractions or set the molalities
   *
   *   The following functions are used to set the state:

   * Mechanical properties
   * </H3>
   *
   *  The %ThermoPhase object specifies the mechanical equation of state of the
   *  phase. Functions which are defined at the %ThermoPhase level to give the
   *  user more information about the mechanical properties are:
   *
   *       - ThermoPhase::pressure()
   *       - ThermoPhase::isothermalCompressibility()
   *       - ThermoPhase::thermalExpansionCoeff()
   *       .
   *
   * <H3>
   * Treatment of the %Phase Potential and the electrochemical potential of a species
   * </H3>
   *
   *  The electrochemical potential of species k in a phase p, \f$ \zeta_k \f$,
   *  is related to the chemical potential via
   *  the following equation, 
   * 
   *       \f[
   *            \zeta_{k}(T,P) = \mu_{k}(T,P) + z_k \phi_p 
   *       \f]
   *
   *   where  \f$ \nu_k \f$ is the charge of species k, and \f$ \phi_p \f$ is
   *   the electric potential of phase p.
   *      
   *  The potential  \f$ \phi_p \f$ is tracked and internally storred within
   *  the base %ThermoPhase object. It constitutes a specification of the
   *  internal state of the phase; it's the third state variable, the first 
   *  two being temperature and density (or, pressure, for incompressible
   *  equations of state). It may be set with the function,
   *  ThermoPhase::setElectricPotential(),
   *  and may be queried with the function ThermoPhase::electricPotential().
   *  
   *  Note, the overall electrochemical potential of a phase may not be
   *  changed by the potential because many phases enforce charge
   *  neutrality:
   *
   *       \f[
   *            0 = \sum_k z_k X_k
   *       \f]
   *
   *  Whether charge neutrality is necessary for a phase is also specified
   *  within the ThermoPhase object, by the function call
   *  ThermoPhase::chargeNeutralityNecessary(). Note, that it is not
   *  necessary for the IdealGas phase, currently. However, it is
   *  necessary for liquid phases such as Cantera::DebyeHuckel and
   *  Cantera::HMWSoln for the proper specification of the chemical potentials.
   *
   *
   *  This equation, when applied to the \f$ \zeta_k \f$ equation described
   *  above, results in a zero net change in the effective Gibbs free
   *  energy of the phase. However, specific charged species in the phase
   *  may increase or decrease their electochemical potentials, which will
   *  have an effect on interfacial reactions involving charged species,
   *  when there is a potential drop between phases. This effect is used
   *  within the Cantera::InterfaceKinetics and Cantera::EdgeKinetics kinetics 
   *  objects classes.
   *  
   *
   *  Other internal state variables, that track the treatment of other
   *  potential energy contributions, by adding contributions to the
   *  chemical potential to create an effective chemical potential, 
   *  may be added at a later time.
   *
   *  <H3>
   *   Specification of Activities and Activity Conventions
   *  </H3>
   * 
   *
   * The activity \f$a_k\f$ and activity coefficient \f$ \gamma_k \f$ of a 
   * species in solution is related to the chemical potential by 
   *
   * \f[ 
   *    \mu_k = \mu_k^0(T,P) + \hat R T \log a_k.= \mu_k^0(T,P) + \hat R T \log x_k \gamma_k
   * \f] 
   *
   * The quantity \f$\mu_k^0(T,P)\f$ is
   * the standard chemical potential at unit activity, 
   * which depends on the temperature and pressure, 
   * but not on the composition. The
   * activity is dimensionless. Within liquid electrolytes its common to use a 
   * molality convention, where solute species employ the molality-based
   * activity coefficients:
   *
   * \f[
   *  \mu_k =  \mu_k^\triangle(T,P) + R T ln(a_k^{\triangle}) = 
   *            \mu_k^\triangle(T,P) + R T ln(\gamma_k^{\triangle} \frac{m_k}{m^\triangle}) 
   * \f]
   *
   * And, the solvent employs the following convention
   * \f[
   *    \mu_o = \mu^o_o(T,P) + RT ln(a_o) 
   * \f]
   *
   * where \f$ a_o \f$ is often redefined in terms of the osmotic coefficient \f$ \phi \f$.
   *
   *   \f[
   *       \phi = \frac{- ln(a_o)}{\tilde{M}_o \sum_{i \ne o} m_i}
   *   \f]
   *
   *  %ThermoPhase classes which employ the molality based convention are all derived
   *  from the MolalityVPSSTP class. See the class description for further information
   *  on its capabilities. 
   *
   *  The activity convention used by a %ThermoPhase object 
   *  may be queried via the ThermoPhase::activityConvention() function. A zero means molar based,
   *  while a one means molality based.
   *
   *  The function ThermoPhase::getActivities() returns a vector of activities. Whether these are
   *  molar-based or molality-based depends on the value of activityConvention().
   *
   *  The function getActivityCoefficients() always returns molar-based activity
   *  coefficients regardless of the activity convention used. The function
   *  MolalityVPSSTP::getMolalityActivityCoefficients() returns molality
   *  based activity coefficients for those ThermoPhase objects derived
   *  from the MolalityVPSSTP class. The function MolalityVPSSTP::osmoticCoefficient()
   *  returns the osmotic coefficient.
   *
   *  <H3>
   *   Activity Concentrations: Relationship of %ThermoPhase to %Kinetics Expressions
   *  </H3>
   *
   *   %Cantera can handle both thermodynamics and kinetics mechanisms. Reversible
   *   kinetics
   *   mechanisms within %Cantera must be compatible with thermodynamics in the
   *   sense that at equilibrium, or at infinite times, the concentrations
   *   of species must conform to thermodynamics. This means that for every
   *   valid reversible kinetics reaction in a mechanism, it must be reducible to 
   *   an expression involving the ratio of the product activity to
   *   the reactant activities being equal to the exponential of the
   *   dimensionless standard state gibbs free energies of reaction.
   *   Irreversible kinetics reactions do not have this requirement; however,
   *   their usage can yield unexpected and inconsistent results in many
   *   situations.
   *   The actual units used in a kinetics expression depend
   *   on the context or the relative field of study. For example, in 
   *   gas phase kinetics, species in kinetics expressions are expressed in
   *   terms of concentrations, i.e., gmol cm-3. In solid phase studies,
   *   however, kinetics is usually expressed in terms of unitless activities,
   *   which most often equate to solid phase mole fractions. In order to 
   *   accomodate variability here, %Cantera has come up with the idea
   *   of activity concentrations, \f$ C^a_k \f$. Activity concentrations are the expressions
   *   used directly in kinetics expressions.    
   *   These activity (or generalized) concentrations are used
   *   by kinetics manager classes to compute the forward and
   *   reverse rates of elementary reactions. Note that they may
   *   or may not have units of concentration --- they might be
   *   partial pressures, mole fractions, or surface coverages,
   *   The activity concentrations for species <I>k</I>, \f$ C^a_k \f$, are 
   *   related to the activity for species, k, \f$ a_k \f$,
   *   via the following expression:
   *
   *   \f[
   *       a_k = C^a_k / C^0_k
   *   \f]

   *  \f$ C^0_k \f$ are called standard concentrations. They serve as multiplicative factors
   *  bewteen the activities and the generalized concentrations. Standard concentrations
   *  may be different for each species. They may depend on both the temperature
   *  and the pressure. However, they may not depend
   *  on the composition of the phase. For example, for the IdealGasPhase object
   *  the standard concentration is defined as
   *
   *  \f[
   *     C^0_k = P/ R T 
   *  \f]
   *  
   *  In many solid phase kinetics problems,
   *
   *   \f[
   *     C^0_k = 1.0 ,
   *  \f]
   *
   *  is employed making the units for activity concentrations in solids unitless.
   *  
   *  %ThermoPhase member functions dealing with this concept include 
   *  ThermoPhase::getActivityConcentrations() , which provides a vector of the current
   *  activity concentrations. The function, ThermoPhase::standardConcentration(int k=0) returns
   *  the standard concentration of the kth species. The function,
   *  ThermoPhase::logStandardConc(int k=0), returns the natural log of the kth standard
   *  concentration. The function  ThermoPhase::getUnitsStandardConc() returns a vector of 
   *  doubles, specifying the MKS units of the standard concentration of the
   *  kth species.
   *
   *
   *  <H3>
   *  Initialization of %ThermoPhase Objects within %Cantera
   *  </H3>
   *
   *  Instantiation of %ThermoPhase properties occurs by reading and
   *  processing the XML data contained within an ctxml data file.
   *  First a call to  newPhase(std::string file, std::string id) or
   *  newPhase(XML_Node &phase)
   *  is made. The arguments serve to specify the
   *  XML data structure containing the phase information.
   *
   *  Within newPhase() a determination of what type of %ThermoPhase object should be 
   *  used is made. This is done within the routine ThermoFactory::newThermoPhase(std::string model)
   *  or related routines.
   *  Once the correct %ThermoPhase derived object is selected and instantiated with a 
   *  bare constructor, the
   *  function Cantera::importPhase() is called with the  %ThermoPhase derived object as
   *  one of its arguments.
   *
   *  Within importPhase(), a decision is made as to what type of
   *  standard state, i.e.,
   *  either a reference state (just T dependent)  or a standard state
   *  (both P and T dependent), is to be used to calculate the
   *  standard state properties of the species within the phase.
   *  If only a reference state is needed 
   *  then a call to 
   *  \link #newSpeciesThermoMgr(std::vector<XML_Node*> spData_nodes, SpeciesThermoFactory* f=0, bool opt=false) newSpeciesThermoMgr()\endlink
   *  is made in order
   *  pick a manager, i.e., a derivative of the SpeciesThermo 
   *  object, to use.
   *
   *  If a temperature and pressure dependent standard state is needed 
   *  then a call to VPSSMgrFactory::newVPSSMgr()
   *  is made in order
   *  pick a manager, i.e., a derivative of the VPSSMgr 
   *  object, to use. Along with the VPSSMgr designation comes a 
   *  determination of whether there is an accompanying  SpeciesThermo 
   *  and what type of SpeciesThermo object to use in the
   *  VPSSMgr calculations.
   *  
   *  Once these determinations are made, the %ThermoPhase object is
   *  ready to start reading in the species information, which includes
   *  all of the available standard state information about the
   *  species. this is done within the routine installSpecies().
   *  
   *  Within installSpecies(), most of the common steps for adding a
   *  species are carried out. The element stoichiometry is read
   *  and elements are added as needed to the list of elements
   *  kept with the ThermoPhase object. The charge of the species
   *  is read in. The species is added into the list
   *  of species kept within the ThermoPhase object. Lastly, the
   *  standard state thermodynamics for the species is read in.
   *  For reference states, the routine, SpeciesThermoFactory::installThermoForSpecies(),
   *  is used to read in the data. Essentially, this routine is a
   *  factory routine for picking the correct subroutine to 
   *  call to read the XML data from the input file and install the
   *  correct  SpeciesThermoInterpType object into the SpeciesThermo object. 
   *
   *  Within installSpecies(), for standard states, the routine, 
   *  SpeciesThermoFactory::installVPThermoForSpecies() is
   *  called. However, this is just a shell routine for calling
   *  the VPSSMgr's derived VPSSMgr::createInstallPDSS() routine.
   *  Within the  VPSSMgr::createInstallPDSS() routine of the derived VPSSMgr's
   *  object, the XML data from the input file is read and the
   *  calculations for the species standard state is installed.
   *  Additionally, the  derived PDSS object is created and installed
   *  into the VPStandardStateTP list containing all of the PDSS objects
   *  for that phase.
   *
   *  Now that all of the species standard states are read in and
   *  installed into the ThermoPhase object, control once again
   *  is returned to the importPhase() function.  Two derived functions
   *  are then called. The first one, ThermoPhase::initThermo(), is called. In this
   *  routine, all internal arrays within the %ThermoPhase object are
   *  dimensioned according to the number of elements and species.
   *  Then, the function ThermoPhase::initThermoXML() is called.
   *  This function is tasked with reading in all of the thermodynamic
   *  function information specific to the calculation of the
   *  phase information. This includes all of the information about
   *  the activity coefficient calculation.
   *
   *  After the ThermoPhase::initThermoXML() is finished, the
   *  ThermoPhase routine is ready to receive requests for 
   *  thermodynamic property information.
   *  
   *
   *  There is an alternative way to instantiate %ThermoPhase objects that
   *  is applicable to a significant proportion of %ThermoPhase classes.
   *  The phase may be instantiated via a constructor that invokes the
   *  XML data structure wherein the phase information is to be read directly.
   *  In this case, the call to newPhase() and the call to 
   *  ThermoFactory::newThermoPhase(std::string model)
   *  is not made. However, soon after that, the call to importPhase() is
   *  made and thereafter instantiation follows the initialization course described
   *  previously in order to avoid as much duplicate code as possible.
   *  This alternative way to  instantiate %ThermoPhase objects has the 
   *  advantage of working well with hard-coded situations. And, it
   *  works well also with situations where new %ThermoPhase classes 
   *  are being developed and haven't yet made their way into the
   *  factory routines.
   *
   *  <H3>
   *  Adding Additional Thermodynamics Models
   *  </H3>
   *
   *  In general, factory routines throw specific errors when encountering
   *  unknown thermodynamics models in XML files. All of the error classes
   *  derive from the class, CanteraError.
   *  The newVPSSMgr() routines throws the UnknownVPSSMgr class error when
   *  they encounter an unknown string in the XML input file specifying the
   *  VPSSMgr class to use.
   *
   *  Many of the important member functions in factory routines are
   *  virtual classes. This means that a user may write their own
   *  factory classes which inherit from the base %Cantera factory classes
   *  to provide additional %ThermoPhase classes.
   * 
   *

  //!   Base class for a phase with thermodynamic properties. 
  /*!
   * Class %ThermoPhase is the base class for the family of classes
   * that represent phases of matter of any type. It defines a
   * common public interface, and implements a few methods. Most of
   * the methods, however, are declared virtual and are meant to be
   * overloaded in derived classes.  The standard way used
   * throughout Cantera to compute properties of phases of matter is
   * through pointers of type ThermoPhase* that point to objects of
   * subclasses of ThermoPhase.
   * 
   * Class %ThermoPhase extends class Phase by adding methods to compute 
   * thermodynamic
   * properties in addition to the ones (temperature, density,
   * composition) that class Phase provides. The distinction is that
   * the methods declared in ThermoPhase require knowing the
   * particular equation of state of the phase of interest, while
   * those of class Phase do not, since they only involve data values
   * stored within the object.
   *
   * Instances of subclasses of %ThermoPhase should be created using
   * the factory class ThermoFactory, not by calling the constructor
   * directly. This allows new classes to be used with the various
   * Cantera language interfaces.
   * 
   * To implement a new equation of state, derive a class from
   * ThermoPhase and overload the virtual methods in
   * ThermoPhase. Methods that are not needed can be left
   * unimplimented, which will cause an exception to be thrown if it
   * is called.
   *
   * Relationship with the kinetics operator:
   *
   * Describe activity coefficients.
   *
   * Describe K_a, K_p, and K_c, These are three different equilibrium
   * constants. 
   *
   *   K_a is the calculation of the equilibrium constant from the
   *   standard state Gibbs free energy values. It is by definition
   *   dimensionless.
   *
   *   K_p is the calculation of the equilibrium constant from the
   *   reference state gibbs free energy values. It is by definition
   *   dimensionless. The pressure dependence is handled entirely
   *   on the rhs of the equilibrium expression.
   *
   *   K_c is the equilibrium constant calculated from the
   *   activity concentrations. The dimensions depend on the number
   *   of products and reactants.
   *    
   *
   * The kinetics manager requires the calculation of K_c for the
   * calculation of the reverse rate constant
