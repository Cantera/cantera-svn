  /*!
   *  The model is based on that
   *  described by Newman, Electrochemical Systems
   *
   *  The velocity of species i may be described by the
   *  following equation p. 297 (12.1)
   *
   *   \f[
   *     c_i \nabla \mu_i = R T \sum_j \frac{c_i c_j}{c_T D_{ij}}
   *         (\mathbf{v}_j - \mathbf{v}_i)
   *   \f]
   *
   * This as written is degenerate by 1 dof.
   *
   * To fix this we must add in the definition of the mass averaged
   * velocity of the solution. We will call the simple bold-faced 
   *  \f$\mathbf{v} \f$
   * symbol the mass-averaged velocity. Then, the relation
   * between \f$\mathbf{v}\f$ and the individual species velocities is
   * \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$
   *
   *  \f[
   *      \rho_i \mathbf{v}_i =  \rho_i \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{j}_i
   *  \f]
   *   where \f$\mathbf{j}_i\f$ are the diffusional fluxes of species i
   *   with respect to the mass averaged velocity and
   *
   *  \f[
   *       \sum_i \mathbf{j}_i = 0
   *  \f]
   * 
   *  and
   *
   *  \f[
   *     \sum_i \rho_i \mathbf{v}_i =  \rho \mathbf{v} 
   *  \f]
   * 
   * Using these definitions, we can write
   *
   *  \f[
   *      \mathbf{v}_i =  \mathbf{v} + \frac{\mathbf{j}_i}{\rho_i}
   *  \f]
   *
   *
   *  \f[
   *     c_i \nabla \mu_i = R T \sum_j \frac{c_i c_j}{c_T D_{ij}}
   *         (\frac{\mathbf{j}_j}{\rho_j} - \frac{\mathbf{j}_i}{\rho_i})
   *         =  R T \sum_j \frac{1}{D_{ij}}
   *         (\frac{x_i \mathbf{j}_j}{M_j} - \frac{x_j \mathbf{j}_i}{M_i})
   *  \f]
   *
   * The equations that we actually solve are
   *
   *  \f[
   *     c_i \nabla \mu_i =
   *         =  R T \sum_j \frac{1}{D_{ij}}
   *         (\frac{x_i \mathbf{j}_j}{M_j} - \frac{x_j \mathbf{j}_i}{M_i})
   *  \f]
   *  and we replace the 0th equation with the following:
   *
   *  \f[
   *       \sum_i \mathbf{j}_i = 0
   *  \f]
   *
   *  When there are charged species, we replace the rhs with the
   *  gradient of the electrochemical potential to obtain the
   *  modified equation
   *  
   *  \f[
   *     c_i \nabla \mu_i + c_i F z_i \nabla \Phi 
   *         =  R T \sum_j \frac{1}{D_{ij}}
   *         (\frac{x_i \mathbf{j}_j}{M_j} - \frac{x_j \mathbf{j}_i}{M_i})
   *  \f]
   *
   * With this formulation we may solve for the diffusion velocities,
   * without having to worry about what the mass averaged velocity
   * is.
   *
   *  <H2> Viscosity Calculation  </H2>
   * 
   *  The viscosity calculation may be broken down into two parts.
   *  In the first part, the viscosity of the pure species are calculated
   *  In the second part, a mixing rule is applied, based on the
   *  Wilkes correlation, to yield the mixture viscosity.
