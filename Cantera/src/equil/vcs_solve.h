   *   Handling of "Species" Representing Interfacial Voltages
   *  ---------------------------------------------------------
   *
   *      These species have species types of  VCS_SPECIES_TYPE_INTERFACIALVOLTAGE
   *      The chemical potentials for these "species" refer to electrons in
   *      metal electrodes. They have the following formula
   *
   *          m_feSpecies(I) = m_SSfeSpecies(I) - F z[I] / RT
   *
   *      F is Faraday's constant.
   *      R = gas constant
   *      T = temperature
   *      V = potential of the interface = phi_electrode - phi_solution
   *
   *      For these species, the solution vector unknown, z[I], is V, the phase voltage, in volts.
