    Two-dimensional interfaces.
    
    Instances of class Interface represent reacting 2D interfaces
    between bulk 3D phases. Class Interface defines no methods of its
    own. All of its methods derive from either SurfacePhase or Kinetics.

    Function importInterface should usually be used to build an
    Interface object from a CTI file definition, rather than calling
    the Interface constructor directly.

    See: SurfacePhase, Kinetics, importInterface

        defined in the file, src should be specified as 'filename\#id'
        If the file is not CTML, it will be run through the CTI -> CTML
        preprocessor first.

        the definition of this interface, the root of this tree can be
