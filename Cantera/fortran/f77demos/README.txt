This directory contains examples of Fortran 77 programs that use
Cantera. The programs are:

ctlib          An example showing how to write subroutines that emulate those
               of the Chemkin CKLIB library.

isentropic     Mach number vs. area ratio for isentropic flow.

Both of these use the "demo_f77" library that demonstrates one simple
scheme to handle interfacing Fortran 77 and C++. Additional functions
can be added to this library as needed.
