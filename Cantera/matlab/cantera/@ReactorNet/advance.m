function advance(n, tout)
% ADVANCE - Advance the state of the reactor network in time. 
%
%    Method advance integrates the system of ordinary differential
%    equations that determine the rate of change of the volume, the
%    mass of each species, and the total energy for each reactor. The
%    integration is carried out from the current time to time
%    'tout.' (Note 'tout' is an absolute time, not a time interval.)
%    The integrator may take many internal time steps before reaching
%    tout.
