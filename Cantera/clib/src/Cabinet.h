/**
 * Template for classes to hold pointers to objects. The Cabinet<M>
 * class maintains a list of pointers to objects of class M (or of
 * subclasses of M).  These classes are used by the 'clib' interface
 * library functions that provide access to Cantera C++ objects from
 * outside C++. To refer to an existing object, the library functions
 * take an integer argument that specifies the location in the pointer
 * list maintained by the appropriate Cabinet<M> instance. The pointer
 * is retrieved from the list by the interface function, the desired
 * method is invoked, and the result returned to the non-C++ calling
 * procedure. By storing the pointers in a 'cabinet', there is no need
 * to encode them in a std::string or integer and pass them out to the
 * non-C++ calling routine, as some other interfacing schemes do.
 *
 * The Cabinet<M> class can be used to store pointers to any class
 * that is default-constructible (i.e., has a constructor that takes
 * no arguments). The requirement that the class be
 * default-constructible arises since the Cabinet constructor always
 * creates an instance of M by invoking 'new M', and stores a pointer
 * to it as the first entry in the list. In most cases, class M is a
 * base class with virtual methods, and the base class versions of the
 * methods throw CanteraError exceptions. The subclasses overload
 * these methods to implement the desired functionality. Class
 * Cabinet<M> stores only the base-class pointers, but since the
 * methods are virtual, the method of the appropriate subclass will be
 * invoked.
 *
 * The Cabinet<M> class is set up to allow deleting objects in a safe
 * manner, *provided* that method 'delete' is used, and the destructor
 * for the object is not called directly. Method 'delete' does the
 * following. If called with n = 0, it does nothing, since the first
 * object in the list (the default-constructed base class instance) is
 * never destroyed. If called with n > 0, it deletes the object, and
 * replaces the pointer to where the object had been (but is no more)
 * with a pointer to the first object. In this way, if it is deleted
 * again inadvertently nothing happens, and if an attempt is made to
 * reference the object by its index number, the base-class object
 * will be referenced instead, which will throw an exception.  If
 * instead the pointer were stored in the refering code, there would
 * always be the chance that
 *
 * The Cabinet<M> class is implemented as a singlet. The constructor
 * is never explicitly called; instead, static function
 * Cabinet<M>::cabinet() is called to obtain a pointer to the
 * instance. This function calls the constructor on the first call and
 * stores the pointer to this instance. Subsequent calls simply return
 * the already-created pointer.
